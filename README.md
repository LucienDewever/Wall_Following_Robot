# Object Following Robot 

## Funtion
The code will give allow our design to detect objects within a range and dynamically react to such objects in an engaging manner. 

## Getting Started
This is the summary and basic set of instructions to set up Group Two's (High Voltage) follower robot.

#### Environment
All code was exclusively produced inside of the Arduino Create IDE and tested using the Arduino Uno R3

#### Auxillary Components
In order to use this code, the following components are needed:
1. Arduino Uno R3
2. L298n H-Bridge module
3. HC-SR04 UltraSonic Sensor
4. SG90 Servo Motor
5. Two brushed motors with wheels
6. Male-Female & Male-Male Wires
7. 2.5w power Supply

## How to Use
Download the code in the "ArduinoUpload" file and Upload it to the Uno R3 prior to connecting any of auxillary components. Then simply connect the components and the power supply and your follower robot should be operational
